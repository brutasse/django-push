Django-PuSH
===========

PuSH is the other name of `PubSubHubbub`_, a publish/subscribe protocol based
on HTTP and allowing near-instant notifications of topic updates.

* Publishers are entities that publish their updates via HTTP resources. When a
  resource is updated with a new entry, they ping their *hub* saying they have
  some new content. The hub is also declared in the resource.

* Subscribers are feed readers or followers. When they fetch a resource, they
  notice a hub is declared and subscribe to the resource's updates with the
  hub.

* Hubs fetch the published resource when it gets a ping from the publisher and
  takes care of notifying all the subscribers.

This library provides hooks to add PubSubHubbub support to your Django
project: you can use it to be a publisher and/or subscriber.

The PubSubHubbub spec was initially designed for Atom feeds. The `0.3
version`_ of the spec defines resources as feeds. The `0.4`_ version allows
arbitrary content types. The `0.4`_ spec is supported since version **0.5** of
django-push. We unfortunately missed the chance of having version numbers
match properly.

Changelog
---------

* **1.0** (2017-04-25):

  * Confirm support for Django 1.11 (no code changes required).

* **0.9** (2016-07-13):

  * Remove support for Django 1.7.

  * Drop support for Python 3.2.

  * Confirm support for Django 1.10.

* **0.8** (2015-09-29):

  * Remove support for Django < 1.7.

  * Use a transaction hook in ``Subscription.objects.subscribe()`` when
    available (Django 1.9+).

* **0.7** (2015-07-10):

  * Remove warnings with Django versions up to 1.8.

* **0.6.1** (2014-01-14):

  * Added ``PUSH_TIMEOUT`` setting for passing timeouts to the
    subscribe/unsubscribe HTTP calls.

* **0.6** (2013-07-10):

  * Removed ``get_hub()``.

  * Removed the ``unsubscribe()`` manager method. Unsubscribing must be done
    with subscription instances.

  * Added ``request`` and ``links`` keyword arguments to the ``updated``
    signal. ``request`` is the raw HTTP request object, ``links`` is a parsed
    version of the ``Link`` header, if present.

* **0.5** (2013-06-24):

  * Python 3 support, Django >= 1.4.1 support.

  * HTTP handling via requests instead of urllib2.

 Â * Deprecation of ``Subscription.objects.unsubscribe()`` in favor of an
    instance method on the subscription object. The ``unsubscribe()`` manager
    method will be removed in version 0.6.

  * ``Subscription.objects.subscribe()`` raises a warning if the ``hub`` kwarg
    is not provided. It will become mandatory in version 0.6.

  * Removed ``hub.verify_token`` from subscription requests. It's optional in
    the 0.3 spec and absent from the 0.4 spec.

  * Secret generation code uses ``django.utils.crypto`` instead of the
    ``random`` module. In addition, subscriptions over HTTP don't use a secret
    anymore (as recommended in the spec).

  * The ``updated`` signal is sent with the raw payload instead of the result
    of a ``feedparser.parse`` call. This allows other content types than feeds
    to be processed, as suggested in version 0.4 of the PubSubHubbub spec.

  * The callback view is now a class-based view, allowing listening for content
    distribution via a custom view if the ``updated`` signal is not suitable.

  * ``django.contrib.sites`` is no longer a hard requirement. You can set
    ``PUSH_DOMAIN`` in your settings to your site's canonical hostname.

  * South migrations support. If you don't use South, you should. If you're
    upgrading from 0.4, just **fake the first migration** and apply the
    others::

        ./manage.py migrate subscriber 0001_initial --fake
        ./manage.py migrate

  * Tremendously improved admin support. If you were using a custom ModelAdmin
    for subscriptions, you might want to try the built-in one.

* **0.4** (2011-06-30):

  * Support for hub authentication via ``PUSH_HUB_CREDENTIALS``.

  * Support for SSL callback URLs.

* **0.3** (2010-08-18):

  * Subscribers can unsubscribe.

* **0.2** (2010-08-12):

  * Signature handling of content distribution requests.

* **0.1** (2010-08-11):

  * Initial release.
